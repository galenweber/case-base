        Laraguay is a small country in central South America with a population of 6.8 million. The government of Laraguay would like to improve its nascent youth disability assistance program. This national program resembles the so-called special needs programs in the United States, though reduced in quality and scope.

        A small but symbolic piece of these reforms is the improvement of the country’s disability assistance program. Under the dictatorship, the group had received nominal funding, much of it lost to corruption. The current administration hopes that the reformed program will showcase the benefits of reform, while broadcasting a commitment to society’s less privileged.
