        Review quality and quantity of care

        Disability assistance in Laraguay could be assessed across two dimensions: quantity and quality. It would be important to try and develop metrics to measure both.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        On the quantity side, we could look at the following things:
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        How widespread is access to these programs? They’re open to all youth with disabilities, but are they in fact utilized by them? Do utilization rates differ by age, region, or demographics?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        How many centers does the government support as part of this program? As a ratio to the number of disabled youth, does the number of centers broadly match what specialists/reason would recommend?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        On the quality side, we could review the following angles:
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        What is the quality of the programming at these centers? How do the youth spend their time? Does this match the current recommendations of experts?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        What is the quality of the caregivers? What are their credentials?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Is administration of these programs a responsibility of the national government or regional governments? Are funds distributed equitably?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Broadly, how does Laraguay’s disability assistance program compare with similar centers, in the United States, or perhaps regional peers?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        If the interviewer is willing to let you expand further, you could branch out and consider less quantifiable issues and questions, such as:
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        How do these individuals fit into Laraguayan society after they become adults? Do existing programs support this model, or should the model be changed?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Would private programs provide better care than the current government centers? If so, could the government develop a public-private system where the government provides vouchers for private care?
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        There’s a nearly endless set of issues you could touch upon in your response to this question. Just try and focus on putting together a logical and (hopefully) articulate answer.
