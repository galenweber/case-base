          Schuster & Wager (S&W) is one of the largest producers of consumer goods in the United States. For years, sales of consumer goods grew at the same pace as the overall economy. Recently, however, that relationship has broken down. Sales of consumer staples are flat, even as annual GDP growth averaged 2% over the past three years.

          Traditionally, grocery stores and supermarkets have been the main points of sale for toothpaste. But purchases at these locations are on the decline, while sales at discount stores – and to a lesser extent drug stores – are rising.

          Discount stores sell food and household goods, but they also sell tech products, clothes, and a variety of other merchandise. Think of the Walmart chain in the United States. The discount stores, unsurprisingly, tend to discount the price of their goods heavily.

          Note that Crestgate works with outlets – both supermarkets and discount stores – to coordinate pricing and discounts.
